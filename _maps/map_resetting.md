# Skyrat Map Information

## Map resetting /TG/ maps

TG maps do periodically need reset to standard, say, in the event of a mass renaming or game critical department update. This is split into **TWO** categories: **Critical** and **Non-Critical**.

When performing a reset, it is important to ensure you keep an OLD version of the reset map, a version that is untouched, so that people can reference this map to bring over non-critical changes. This will be deleted the next reset and redone.

## Critical Changes:
Critical changes are changes that **NEED** be reset during the main reset PR.
- Security:
- - Add Ammo Workbench
- - Add Gun Vendor
- Armory:
- - Replace Disablers With Smartgun
- - Replace Shotguns With Shotgun Spawners
- - Replace Energy Guns With MCRS
- - Replace Laser Guns With CMGs
- Security Medics Room:
- - Security Medics Spawner
- - Security Medics Locker
- Arrival Docks:
- - Arrival Shuttle Docking Port Resize
- - Arrival Shuttle Console
- Central Command Ferry Hangar (inside Arrival area)
- Barbershop


## Non-Critical Changes
These are changes that are not integral to gameplay and can be brought over in subsequent PRs.
- Xenoarch Base (Lavaland)
- Modular pets: E-N (Robotics), Poppy (Engineering), Bumbles (Hydroponics) and Markus (Cargo)
- Drone Dispensers added to all maps
- Cryopods (inside Recreational/Dormitory area)
